        <h1>Grace Conturso's Biography</h1>
            
        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
    
        <p>  Hello! My name is Grace Conturso. I am currently a junior at Syracuse University majoring in Innovation, Society & Technology. I am passionate about the global usage of technology and the innovative ways we can <strong>create</strong> and <strong>inspire</strong> new ideas within the technology and data field. </p>
       
       <p> I hold an executive position in the Women in Technology club here at school, where I run our social media page and faciliate meetings with my other elected peers. My best skills I can bring to the table are Communication, Problem-Solving, Creativity and Leadership. </p>

        <p>Outside of work and school, Iâ€™m a major foodie. I love trying new foods and restaurants and am always looking for the next best rated place to land a reservation. </p> 
        
        My favorite foods include ...
        <ul>
            <li>Seafood Risotto from Capri, Italy</li>
            <li>Pizza from Rome, Italy</li>
            <li>Cheese and Homeade Sausage (Made by my Grandfather)</li>
        </ul>


        <p>
        I love fashion and analyzing new fashion trends. I also am a die-hard rom-com fanatic and have probably watched every romantic comedy movie under the sun. I live in New Jersey, just about a 30 minute drive from New York City. I have two brothers, one is 22, and the other is 15. My parents and grandparents are my greatest inspiration in life and I am so thankful for their support and love that they give me everyday! 
        </p>
